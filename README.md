# Technical Challenge: Frontend Software Engineering

Welcome to your technical challenge.
This challenge is to validate your ability as a Frontend Software Engineer with Wannabe.
For this challenge, we expect you to develop an application that uses the Swapi.dev API and
deploys it at Vercel.
Your app must have the following:

- A view where the user can see a list of the characters returned by the API: <https://swapi.dev/>
- The view must have pagination.
- A way to find characters such as filters or a search box.
- A view where the user can see the detail of a specific character.
  Must have:
- Bootstrap or Tailwind for the UI.
- Server-side rendering for each view in the application.
- Reusable components with included documentation inside the code to explain the logic
  of each component and how you make it reusable.
- Proper use of git. Please don ÃÅt upload your project to GitHub with just one commit; we
  want to see how you use GitHub and how you document each change in your code.
  Good Luck!
